- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @wandering-nimbus
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software development. Particularly front-end and back-end development.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m a university student doing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science.
- âš¡ Fun fact: My journey into software development started when I was 7 years old while I was playing "Need for Speed: Porsche". I wanted to make my own game, so naturally, software development was the next logical step.
